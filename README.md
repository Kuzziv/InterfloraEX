# Reflections and Future Improvements

After reading the assignment, I decided to implement a console application in C# to ensure a solid understanding of its requirements. Once I had built the initial version of the application, I proceeded to create a separate project using Razor Pages. However, during the process, I encountered difficulties with my database configuration. I dedicated around an hour trying to resolve the issue but eventually realized that, given the three-hour time frame, it would not be feasible to complete the task using Razor Pages. Consequently, I returned to my console application and rebuilt it, including writing unit tests for the core class.

Given more time for this assignment, I would have attempted to reimplement the solution using C# with Razor Pages, enabling the development of a web application. However, my limited experience with Entity Framework became a hindrance in achieving the desired outcome within the given constraints.

These challenges and time limitations provided valuable insights into areas for improvement. Specifically, I recognize the potential to leverage Entity Framework and Razor Pages to create a more comprehensive and interactive solution. Exploring these technologies further would have allowed me to deliver a more robust application.

Overall, this experience has deepened my understanding of the assignment and highlighted areas where further development and learning can take place
